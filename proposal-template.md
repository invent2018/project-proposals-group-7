# Superior Fencing Mask
## Fency & Fenctional

Group members: 
* Crystal
* Pan Yue

## Audience
Beginner fencers, especially those wearing glasses.
 

## Problems
1. Current standard fencing masks are not compatible with glasses, forcing fencers with myopia/other vision problems to fence blind or get contacts
2. Masks are badly ventilated, subjecting the fencer to excessive heat and sweating
3. Masks are not customised for Singapore's humid climate, rusting easily
4. Masks are difficult to wear and remove


## Solution
Our solution is a easy-to-wear, friendly-to-use mask that maximises comfort during training. 
1. Fixation device to stablise glasses inside mask
2. Physical design(?) that allows ventilation
3. Special rust resistant paint
4. Magnetic rather than vecro strips
5. * Sensors that monitors fencer's body index e.g heart rate, body temperature

## Assumptions
Fencers want more comfortable masks.
Fencers are willing to use a non-standard mask during training.


## Unique Selling Point
Our version will succeed because we address problems fellow fencers are constantly annoyed by, and will (probably) be able to keep the price low.
